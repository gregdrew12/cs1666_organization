# CS1666 Platformer Management weeks

1. 9/15 - 9/21
	* Manager: Andrew Ashley
	* Goals:
		1. Get project description and goals approved
1. 9/29 - 10/5
	* Manager: Joshua Mateer
	* Goals:
		1. Create team credits sequence for the game
1. 10/6 - 10/19
	* Manager: Alvyn Berg
	* Goals:
		1. Main: Spawn player image and move it around 
                        the window to collide with stone platforms 
                        and a 'level-cleared' hit-box. 
		1. Networking team: Each person on Networking team 
			builds a web-server, following the final 
			project in the Rust Book
		1. Physics Team:  Implement basic gravity and basic 
                        movement (acceleration and jumping)
1. 10/20 - 10/26
	* Manager: Jake Sweeney
	* Goals:
		1. Main: Get the character animated (left and right movement animation, 
		         as well as jumping animation), and add a main menu
		3. Networking team: Create a basic server that receives player locations 
		         and broadcasts them to a client program
		5. Physics Team:  Implement rectangle colliders for player, floor tiles, 
		         and portal mechanics
1. 10/27 - 11/2
	* Manager: Kira Tsvetkova
	* Goals:
		1. Basic graphics done (all sprites and level assets)
		2. Basic rigidbody physics system done (rectangular colliders that have gravity/weight/friction)
		3. Basic portal creation/traversal (objects can teleport but do not conserve momentum)
		4. One basic "test" level to show off mechanics
		5. Progress towards online functionality
1. 11/3 - 11/9
	* Manager: Austin Brothers
	* Goals:
		1. Main: 
		 	- Create a bugs markdown file, to monitor bugs found with the game. Start fixing bugs as they are found. 
		 	- Implement a system to support multiple levels.
		2. Networking:
			- Have host and remote instances communicate across two separate systems.
			- Send and unpack bytes for animations an portals so remote instance reflects portal postitions and animations of host instance.
		3. Physics:
			- Add block and player's ability to carry block. Implement collision resolutions for block object.
			- Work on conserving momentum when hopping through a ground portal to a wall portal. If player has momentum in the y direction
			and enters a ground portal, that momentum should be conserved in the x direction, when exiting a wall portal.
1. 11/10 - 11/16
	* Manager: Evan Moran
	* Goals:
		1. General: 
		 	- Have Player Death Condition and Reset Player Position to level start
		 	- Add Ability to Cleanly End Credits Early
		 	- Continue to Identify and Fix Bugs
		2. Networking:
			- Finish Support for Separate System Play
			- Add Multithreading Support
		3. Physics:
			- Complete Pick-up-able Block implementation
			- Implement the ability for blocks to go through portals
1. 11/17 - 11/30

	* Goals:
		1. GOALHERE
		...
1. 12/1 - 12/7
	* Manager: Bryce Anderson
	* Goals:
		1. GOALHERE
