## Presentation 1: Roguelike

* **The importance of procedural generation in a roguelike (~10 min)**
	* Short overview of our game and mechanics
	* Definition of procedural generation
		* Examples of things that are often procedurally generated
	* Reasons why procedural generation is important
	* Examples of games that use procedural generation

	* Second algorithm we considered (Cyclic Procedural Content Generation)
		* How it works
		* Advantages
		* Drawbacks
* **The procedural generation strategy we chose (~10 min)**
	* How it works
	* Why we chose this algorithm over the others
	* Foreseeable issues with this algorithm in our game
